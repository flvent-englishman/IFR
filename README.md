# I.F.R. | Inline Frame Router
Go incognito with this mutlitool bookmarklet that can pretty much never be blocked! <br>

## üëã | For Users
Go to the 'bookmarklet.js' file and copy everything there. Then paste it into the bookmarks bar by right-clicking on it. Note that many websites don't allow iframes so if you're wondering why it doesn't seem to work that's why. Go to Google to use IFR since your school most probably hasn't blocked Google.

Press the 'X' button in the top-left to close IFR, and press the '-' button to minimize IFR in case you want to hide it but also save what you were doing. Finally the '+' button is a dropdown that opens the menu which contains many tools, of which I will be constantly updating and adding more of. Also, use YouTube NC to watch YouTube videos since regular YouTube don't allow people to make them into an iframe. To do this copy the video link and then paste it into the tool in the menu.


### ‚ùì FAQ
* How does this work? IFR embeds an iframe within the current website you're on so whatever you do within IFR won't show up in your history!
* Why doesn't it work? Most websites don't allow people to make iframes of them to avoid impersonation, but Google, Wikipedia, and a few other websites do!
* Can this unblock websites? No, this can not unblock websites. I am however looking to make a proxy within a bookmarklet so that way it can't really get blocked!

### ü™≤ Debugging
* If you see a piece of paper with a sad face when you use IFR then that most liekly means that website doesn't allow iframes/to be made into an inframe.
* Go to "https://www.google.com/" to use IFR since they allow iframes, but your school websites probably don't have iframes blocked either since they usually lack security.

## üíª | For Developers 
My code is pretty much always open source and anyone can copy it, so if you see something you can improve tell me on Discord at 'thereallyreal'!

### ‚≠ê Updates (v1.2)
1. The buttons now go translucent when IFR is hovered upon
2. Added two new tools to the menu (tab cloak & random Wikipedia article)
3. I added some other things too but I forgot...
4. A couple of bug fixes
5. Performance boosts, maybe..?

### üìù To-Do
1. Introduce a light mode and dark mode.
2. Make the code more beautiful-looking and take up less space.
3. Keep on adding more tools...
