# I.F.R. | Inline Frame Rerouter
Hide your search history and leave your teachers clueless with this multi-tool bookmarklet! <br>

## 👋 | For Users
Go to the 'bookmarklet.js' file and copy everything there. Create a bookmarklet and paste the coce into the link section, yoi can choose to name it whatever you want. Then clikc on the bookmark whenever you want to use it (doesn't work on non-internet tabs like new tab or settings).

### ❓ FAQ
1. Does this unblock websites? No.
2. Can this make you completely untraceable? No, teachers can still see what you're doing if they look at your screen.
3. How does this work? Opens Google in an iframe which is basically just a website inside another.
4. What's the benefits of using this? Hide your search history and make teachers think you're just on an innocent website.

### 🪲 Debugging
* If you see "This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue." then that means that website doesn't allow iframes.
* A good bunch of websites don't allow iframes, so take note of that as you're using IFR (I like to use https://www.google.com since they allow iframes).
* For YouTube links, most should work (except for videos with embed disabled) but if they don't just go to that YouTube video via the internet.

## 💻 | For Developers 
My code is pretty much always open source and anyone can copy it, so if you see something you can improve tell me on Discord @thereallyreal!

### 📝 To-Do
1. Make the UI better looking.
2. Add more features (like tab cloaking).
