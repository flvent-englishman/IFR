# I.F.R. | Inline Frame Rerouter
Hide your search history and from Hapara with this multitool that has a YouTube NC function as well! <br>

## 👋 | For Users
Go to the 'bookmarklet.js' file and copy everything there. Then paste it into the bookmarks bar by right-clicking on it. Many websites don't allow iframes so if it doesn't work try it on another website (Google allows iframes so I like to use it there). Press the X button in the top-left to close the iframe, press the play button to paste a YouTube link to turn it into YouTube NC, allowing you to watch it, and press the pencil button to rename the tab.

### ❓ FAQ
1. Does this unblock websites? No.
2. Can this make you completely untraceable? No, teachers can still see what you're doing if they look at your screen.
3. How does this work? Opens Google in an iframe which is basically just a website inside another.
4. What's the benefits of using this? Hide your search history and make teachers think you're just on an innocent website.

### 🪲 Debugging
* If you see "This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue." then that means that website doesn't allow iframes.
* A good bunch of websites don't allow iframes, so take note of that as you're using IFR.
* For YouTube links, most should work (except for videos with embed disabled) but if they don't just go to that YouTube video via the internet.

## 💻 | For Developers 
My code is pretty much always open source and anyone can copy it, so if you see something you can improve tell me on Discord @thereallyreal!

### 📝 To-Do
1. Make the UI better looking.
2. Add more features (like tab cloaking).
