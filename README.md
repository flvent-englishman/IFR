# I.F.R. | Inline Frame Rerouter
Go incognito with this mutlitool bookmarklet that can pretty much never be blocked! <br>

## üëã | For Users
Go to the 'bookmarklet.js' file and copy everything there. Then paste it into the bookmarks bar by right-clicking on it. Note that many websites don't allow iframes so if you're wondering why it doesn't seem to work that's why. Use Google to use IFR since your school most probably hasn't blocked Google.

Press the 'X' button to close IFR, and press the '-' button to minimize IFR in case you want to hide it but also save what you were doing. Finally the '+' button is a dropdown that contains many tools, of which I will be constantly updating and adding more of.


### ‚ùì FAQ
1. Does this unblock websites? No.
2. Can this make you completely untraceable? No, teachers can still see what you're doing if they look at your screen.
3. How does this work? Opens Google in an iframe which is basically just a website inside another.
4. What's the benefits of using this? Hide your search history and make teachers think you're just on an innocent website.

### ü™≤ Debugging
* If you see "This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue." then that means that website doesn't allow iframes.
* A good bunch of websites don't allow iframes, so take note of that as you're using IFR.
* For YouTube links, most should work (except for videos with embed disabled) but if they don't just go to that YouTube video via the internet.
